# OpenMP-assignment1

Write a program which states if a certain number is divisible by 5 or not
the program input: a vector of 15 integer numbers and the program
output a vector of 15 binary numbers (0 or 1), 0 states that the number is
not divisible by 5 and 1 state that the number is divisible by 5
Parallelize the previous code using OpenMP and test the correctness of
the output, use single construct for variable declaration and print
the thread id which will perform this operation

this program is wriiten in c++ using qt Creator

to compile from terminal
g++ -o outputName main.cpp
